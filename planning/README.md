# Pictionary-like Web App

My goal is to build a pictionary-like web game that allows to users to play with each other online. One user gets control of the canvas and the other user has to get what the other player is drawing. 

The drawer is given a word to draw, the guesser has to type that word in some kind of prompt. If the guesser gets it right the game is over. 

Some ideas to think about:
1. Drawer gets notified what incorrect guess was made.
2. Lock access of the canvas to the drawer only.
3. Have multiple people connect (and only the drawer has access to the canvas).
4. Points system? Trophy system?
5. Daily challenges?

## MVP

To reach MVP, I would like my game to be playable by 2 people with. Drawer has access to an easy-to-use drawing tool. Try and have different views depending on what kind of player you are. The guesser has to type the correct word in to stop the game.

## Bonus

Once I have reached MVP, I want to add some UX improvements to make the game more aesthetically pleasing and easier to use/understand.

Maybe allow more than 2 players (only one drawer). Maybe have multiple drawers in a different game mode.

Also, add a backend so a user can login and access their points/trophies/achievements.
